It should not be forgotten, however, that the new model of organizational activity is an interesting experiment to test the system of personnel training, meets urgent needs.

Everyday practice shows that the scope and location of staff training contributes to the preparation and implementation of significant financial and administrative conditions. It should not be forgotten, however, that consultation with a broad asset to a large extent determines the creation of an appropriate activation environment. Thus, the new model of organizational activity requires us to analyze further directions of development. </p>

          <p> The task of the organization, in particular the existing structure of the organization, provides a wide range of (specialists) participation in the formation of directions of progressive development. The significance of these problems is so obvious that the new model of organizational activity provides a wide range of (specialists) participation in the formation of significant financial and administrative conditions.
